## Person 3

Context: 
Doing homework at house on thursday night (9pm) with me and 2 more people. She is working on a problem set. 

General notes:
For the first 15 mins she was generally focused with only minor conversation distractions from the people around her and answering 2 homework related texts. 
Was reminded of a tweet she’d shared earlier that day and then went to look for the exact one. 
Ended up staying on twitter and scrolling through feed (uses twitter often) for 5 minutes.
Liking mostly 
Looking at others likes/profiles
Said she had already gone through most of the content on her feed earlier in the day

Back to homework for ~6 minutes 
Noted that the question she was working on was really hard and had small conversation explaining the problem with other person we were with 
Looked back at homework and wrote down a few words but got stuck
Opened facebook on computer and checked 2 notifications which 1 brought her to an event page 
Talked about party event with group  
End of 30 minutes 

Overall seemed like it was more likely 

How frequently they are on social media sites 
Visited 2 different ones 1 time each and sent some texts
Which mediums they primarily use (devices, sites) 
Phone for twitter, laptop for facebook 
How long they are on SM for
About 15 mins 
What contexts they are using social media 
1 when reminded of it 
2 when bored or trying to distract from work
General patterns when using social media - are they messaging? Are they browsing? 
Mostly all browsing , no posting, answered about 3-4 messages throughout the 30 minutes
Are the posting?
no
Are they using social media on its own or are they multi-tasking? 
Kind of on its own (had twitter open on phone while work open on computer but wasn’t trying to do both at once
Personal v business use? 
Personal - answered some texts about homework but only a few
What were they doing before and after using social media? (did they stop working to go on or were they already distracted?) 
Before twitter was doing work but conversation reminded her of some content and it caused her to be distracted for a while after
Opened facebook because frustrated with work - maybe a way to distract herself or not think about the question momentarily
