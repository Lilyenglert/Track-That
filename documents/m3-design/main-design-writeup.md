# Milestone 3: Design

## Brainstorming

To conduct our brainstorming, we aggregated ideas and conducted market research. Some of our raw ideas and mentions included concepts like:

 * Daily Dashboard
 * Like blackboard announcements 
 * Show targets 
 * Topics Grids
 * Way to compartmentalize different kinds of things to track when you initially download the app 
 * Variables + subvariables 
 * Arrows to increment and decrement  
 * Sticky Notes/Google Keep	
 * Sticky Note per each separate topic 
 * Can customize each sticky note 
 * Visualizations	
 * Line Charts (weight use over time) 
 * Reminder toggle
 * User sets when to receive

## Prototyping

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

* We tested our paper prototype with five people from our target group
* After testing our low-fi prototype, we found we need to improve the language of our app. For example, our language of "categories" and "items" were ambiguous and our users were not sure of what to input. 
* The conversational style of our application was too robotic/formal
* We realized we needed to add more navigational buttons, like the "back" button and "edit" button
* Users felt like it took too many clicks to actually input something to track. They would have to create a category and then an item, and then an entry. They would rather do this in one click
* We learned that users weren't too fixed on creating goals. They were satisfied with tracking progress and inputting data
