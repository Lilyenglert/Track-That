# Milestone 2: Gathering Information & Planning
As per the assignment, our product is a general tracking app. 

## Updated Target Users
We have identified three (3) target users for this app to be:
1. Students who want to reach strength goals through exercise.
2. Students who want to reduce everyday finance spending and meet specific budgeting goals.
3. Students who want to reduce their time spent on social media to be productive.

We chose these target users because they are easily accessible on a college campus, and we hypothesize the user target desires are common problems among students.


## Research Methods

We conducted user interviews with students who want to reach strength goals and reduce everyday finance. Interview-style data collection made the most sense because we wanted to learn about the users' personal experiences and perspectives with these intentional and more easily-measureable activites. 

On the other hand, we conducted field studies with our users who wanted to reduce time spent on social media. This data-collection method was better than an interview because users often do not know how much time they already spend on social media.
